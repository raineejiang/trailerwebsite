# Movie Trailer Website
## Project Summary
This is the first project for the Full-stack Nanodegree Program. This project is to create a movie trailer website including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. The data will be served as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.
## Installation
* Make sure to download all of the files in this repository and save the files in the same local folder. The files include, fresh_tomatoes.html, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py, entertainment_center.py, README.md. 
* Open entertainment_center.py through IDLE and then run the module. The trailer webpage should pop up in the browser properly.
